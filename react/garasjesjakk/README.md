This is a tic-tac-toe implementation.

Check it out on [The Awesome Garage - Garasjesjakk](https://garasjesjakk.theawesomegarage.com).

If you want to run it yourself, it's easy to put it into a docker container. [The Awesome Garage - Getting started with React](https://theawesomegarage.com/blog/getting-started-with-nodejs). Just put this folder into the docker working dir - and your set!

All source code is placed in the src-folder. The rest is fluff and stuff to make React work put there by [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app).
